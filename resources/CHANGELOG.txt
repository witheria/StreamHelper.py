OPEN ALPHA 0.3.0


Added:
    - Full eSports UI functionality
    - List item buttons connectivity (except "change")
    - Icons to make it look nicer (credits can be found under the menu item "help")
    - Settings are working now. Please send your suggestions to the dev
    - About tab in the settings displays information
    - Save/Load function is also working for the eSports UI
    - Just try it out, it's the best for finding bugs which you can then send me (hehe)

Removed:
    - Chrono Item (still in development)
    - Mask functions aren't taking space away now
    - Other unnecessary code snippets and garbage
    - API functionality (sad League noises)

Will be probably implemented in the next update:
    - Chrono Items (Timers)
    - Teams implementation
    - More customization and settings
    - Drag enabled lists (You will be able to drag items into the other list!)

On the TODO-List:
    - Drag and Drop interactions with files and links
    - APIs (Toornament, LoL, RocketLeague, Overwatch)
    - Team Tree
    - More settings
    - More design options
    - Upgrade to PyQt6 (well, far, far away)


Hear me out, this was a disaster to program. It took so much time I even had to make a whole update dedicated to that
(see 0.2.2). I believe I'm at around 250 work hours into this, so, can't quit now I guess.

The JSON stuff is working perfectly, I'm keeping it and with that the program simple.

Log functionality is still in development, I will probably need to restructure a lot of this stuff to make it work
properly. Exceptions aren't caught yet, start the program from the command line to see them. A lot is still just "print".

CLOSED ALPHA 0.2.2


Added:
    - Save/Load function (also Autosave works again)
    - The Lists are back up and working again
    - eSports UI (Not connected yet)
    - API functionality (retrieve summoner name from client)


This update was kind of heavy, I rewrote the whole textlists idea. Formerly split into several methods,
I subclassed the QListWidgetItem class into the elements I'll be using.
It will be interesting to see where this road leads to.

Also, I will not be using XML formatted data in my files anymore. JSON proved to be faster and more flexible,
so that's my format of choice now.

It took way too much time to get everything back up and running again,
but well, it is much less text now ( getTextofItem() was 147 lines, now its like 50 ).

************************************************************************************************************************
CLOSED ALPHA 0.2.1


Added:
    - Settings window
    - Settings UI
    - Config File functionality

Temporarily REMOVED:
    - Save/Load function
    - Text and Number widgets

************************************************************************************************************************
CLOSED ALPHA 0.2.0


Added:
    - The LoL Mask to have everything neatly fit in with your gaming needs
    - Full mask functionality
    - Configs can now be imported and exported
    - A "Settings" Menu Option for your convenience

+++ A guide and startup manual will be written and released soon, even though there aren't many features yet +++

APIs are not working yet. This will come in a later update

I have also distanced myself from the "Mask" idea that I initially had ( import mask when you need it,
remove if you dont ), because it is simply too much work to implement it. So, the package will just include everything
and you WILL BE ABLE to remove some UIs/tabs in the settings later on. They wont get fully deleted, but wont
load on startup, so that's a plus i guess.

I split all the code in several different files for organizing purposes. Feel free to comment on this, I thought it
would be better than having everything in like three files.

************************************************************************************************************************
CLOSED ALPHA 0.1.1

    - Chrono Widgets
    - The "Credits" Menu option is now working
    - You can now choose between dark mode and light mode + basic settings are available

Lets hope I can get the masks working soon, I'd love to see that idea in action
