CLOSED ALPHA 0.2.1

Added:
    - The LoL Mask to have everything neatly fit in with your gaming needs
    - Full mask functionality
    - Configs can now be imported and exported
    - A "Settings" Menu Option for your convenience

+++ A guide and startup manual will be written and released soon, even though there aren't many features yet

APIs are not working yet. This will come in a later update

I have also distanced myself from the "Mask" idea that I initially had ( import mask when you need it,
remove if you dont ), because it is simply too much work to implement it. So, the package will just include everything
and you WILL BE ABLE to remove some UIs/tabs in the settings later on. They wont get fully deleted, but wont
load on startup, so that's a plus i guess.

I split all the code in several different files for organizing purposes. Feel free to comment on this, I thought it
would be better than having everything in like three files.


CLOSED ALPHA 0.1.1

Added:
    - Chrono Widgets
    - The "Credits" Menu option is now working
    - You can now choose between dark mode and light mode + basic settings are available

+++ The program also works on Linux now, though no package has been made yet +++

Lets hope I can get the masks working soon, I'd love to see that idea in action
